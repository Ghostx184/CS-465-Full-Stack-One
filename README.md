Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
In this full stack we used the Mean architecture(MongoDB,Express,Angular, and Node.js)
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
if NoSQL not using a backend its helpful to know that not relying the Schema Makes it easer to store data since not all data is needed up front.
Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
You can do things in Javascript using JSON pieces.
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
Not relying on Schema makes it easier to not need all the data upfront
Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Security is needed to protect sensitive data the program is designed to use a user name and password to protect the data.
